abstract: "BigBWA is a new tool that uses the Big Data technology Hadoop to boost the performance of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA). Important reductions in the execution times were observed when using this tool. In addition, BigBWA is fault tolerant and it does not require any modification of the original BWA source code."
